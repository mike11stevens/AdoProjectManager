```json
{
  "AdoConnectionSettings": {
    "OrganizationUrl": "https://dev.azure.com/your-organization",
    "PersonalAccessToken": "your-personal-access-token",
    "DefaultClonePath": "C:\\Projects"
  }
}
```

2. To get a Personal Access Token:
   - Go to your Azure DevOps organization
   - Click on your profile picture ‚Üí Personal access tokens
   - Click "New Token"

2. Configure the clone settings:
   - **Local Path**: Relative path under the default clone directory
   - **Branch**: Branch to clone (defaults to "main")
   - **Include Submodules**: Whether to include Git submodules
3. Click "Start Clone" to begin the cloning process

## Security Considerations

- Never commit your Personal Access Token to source control
- Consider using user secrets for development: `dotnet user-secrets`
- Use environment variables or Azure Key Vault for production deployments
- Ensure your PAT has minimal required permissions

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

- Verify your Organization URL is correct
- Check that your Personal Access Token is valid and has the required scopes
- Ensure your firewall/proxy allows connections to Azure DevOps

### Clone Issues

- Verify you have write permissions to the default clone path
- Check that Git is installed and accessible
- Ensure the repository URL is accessible with your credentials
